🎓 I'm a Software Development student from Brazil passionate about building thoughtful and impactful applications.

### 💻 What I’m working on:
- **iOS apps with Swift** — building clean and beautiful apps using SwiftUI and UIKit. I like working with animations, custom UI, and exploring features like CoreML and Metal for creative use cases.
- **Academic projects with C or C++** — developing small systems and simulations, mostly around optimization models, algorithms, and automation.

### 🌱 What I’m learning:
- **Data structures and algorithms** — studying for programming competitions, with a focus on graphs, recursion, dynamic programming, and problem-solving strategies.
- **Architecture and best practices** — applying SOLID principles, design patterns, and modularization to write scalable and maintainable code.
- **Competitive programming** — training regularly, competing in contests, and leading study groups to help others grow in this area too.

### ⚡ Fun facts about me:
- I love exploring new ideas and technologies — let's connect and build something cool together!  
- I’m also into pets 🐾, sports 🏀, and experimenting in the kitchen 🍝
- I’m passionate about Tetris (my nerdiest trait!)
